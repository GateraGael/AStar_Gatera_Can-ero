Zip File contains:

- readCSV.c //code to read the file
- Astar.c //Astar function to find the optimal reading the .bin file
- Report.pdf //Report of the project
- Folder: Results -> Optimal_Path.txt //Output file of the Astar.c



				***   HOW TO RUN THE CODE  ***

1) Put spain.csv in the same folder as the two codes

2) Compile readCSV.c and run it. The BIN file will be created.

3) Compile Astar.c and run it. The txt with the optimal path will be created.



IMPORTANT NOTE: This code has been written and compiled in MAC OS environment. Some of its 
functions may not work in Windows, although they should work in Linux.



For facility when correcting the project, an additional folder called "Results" is 
located in the .zip compressed folder. This folder contains the .txt file that is 
generated after running the Astar code. It is the same as one should get by running both
codes as stated above.
